        <h1>One Piece</h1>
        <p>I don't know what to say...I'm totally in love with One Piece.
            Years ago, my friend once told me that the top three best anime in the world were
            Bleach, Naruto and One Piece. Since I have watched Bleach and Naruto,
            I totally agreed that Bleach and Naruto were the best. But One Piece???
            I was very doubtful at that time. Why? Because there's no way an anime that is
            childishly drawn could be at the same level as Bleach and Naruto.
            But my friend keep persuading me to watch One Piece and one fateful day,
            I tried to watch it continuously for one whole day.
            Oh my God!!! I was completely stunt! This anime is beyond my expectation.
            What an epic. For me, it was better than Bleach and Naruto.
            Luffy and the Strawhat Crews have their own unique characters that can be related
            to most of us in our daily life. The supporting characters and villains also have
            characteristics that will stuck in you mind for ages. I think that's why One Piece is the best.
            Most of us 'feel' for each of the characters in many ways...may it be in laughter,
            agony, suffering and so much more. Kudos to the One Piece's production team
            especially the amazing creator, Eiichiro Oda; for creating a world that is
            beyond ordinary but still can amuse ordinary people like me and you.

            A must see anime before you die...</p>

        <h2>The Strawhat Pirates</h2>
        <p>The Straw Hat Pirates are a small but powerful pirate crew that
            originated from East Blue, but have various members from different areas.
            They are named after Luffy's signature hat that was given to him by Red-Haired Shanks,
            and are first referred to as the Straw Hat Pirates by Smoker in Alabasta.
            Their crew consists of:
            <ul>
                <li>Roronoa Zoro</li>
                <li>Nami</li>
                <li>Usopp</li>
                <li>Sanji</li>
                <li>Tony Tony Chopper</li>
            </ul>
